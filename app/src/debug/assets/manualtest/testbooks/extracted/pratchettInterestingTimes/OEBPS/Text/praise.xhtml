    DISCWORLD</span></h2>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Smart and funny.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Denver Post</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Humorously entertaining (and subtly thought-provoking) fantasy…Pratchett’s Discworld books are filled with humor and with magic, but they’re rooted in, of all things, real life and cold, hard reason.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Contra Costa Times</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett has created an alternate universe full of trolls, dwarfs, wizards, and other fantasy elements, and he uses that universe to reflect on our own culture with entertaining and gloriously funny results. It’s an accomplishment nothing short of magical.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Terry Pratchett seems constitutionally unable to write a page without at least a twitch of the grin muscles….[But] the notions Pratchett plays with are nae so narrow or nae so silly as your ordinary British farce. Seriously.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">San Diego Union-Tribune</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“If Terry Pratchett is not yet an institution, he should be.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Discworld is more complicated and satisfactory than Oz…. It has the energy of <span class="italic">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</span> and the inventiveness of <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span>. It also has an intelligent wit and a truly original grim and comic grasp of the nature of things.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource">A.S. Byatt</p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“What makes Terry Pratchett’s fantasies so entertaining is that their humor depends on the characters first, on the plot second, rather than the other way around. The story isn’t there simply to lead from one slapstick pratfall to another pun. Its humor is genuine and unforced.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Ottawa Citizen</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett’s humor is international, satirical, devious, knowing, irreverent, unsparing, and, above all, funny.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Kirkus Reviews</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett’s storytelling [is] a clever blend of Monty Pythonesque humor and Big Questions about morality and the workings of the universe.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Publishers Weekly</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“He is head and shoulders above the best of the rest. He is screamingly funny. He is wise. He has style.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (London)</p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett’s writing is hilarious.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Cleveland Plain Dealer</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“The Discworld novels are a phenomenon.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Consistently, inventively mad…wild and wonderful.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett, for those not yet lucky enough to have discovered him, is one of England’s most highly regarded satirists. Nothing—not religion, not politics, not anything—is safe from him.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">South Bend Tribune</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“A master of laugh-out-loud fiction…Pratchett’s ‘Monty Python’-like plots are almost impossible to describe.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett demonstrates just how great the distance is between one- or two-joke writers and the comic masters whose work will be read into the next century.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">Locus</span></p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Terry Pratchett ought to be locked in a padded cell. And forced to write a book a month.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource">Barbara Michaels</p>

    <p class="reviewPageText">“Pratchett is the funniest parodist working in the field today, period.”</p>

    <p class="reviewPageSource"><span class="italic">New York Review of Science Fiction</span></p>
