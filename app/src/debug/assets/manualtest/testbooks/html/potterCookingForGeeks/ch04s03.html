The primary change is, to put it bluntly, that the animal is dead, meaning the circulatory system is no longer supplying the muscle tissue with glycogen from the liver or oxygen-carrying blood. Without oxygen, the cells in the muscle die, and preexisting glycogen in the muscle tissue dissipates, causing the thick and thin myofilaments in the muscle to fire off and bind together (resulting in the state called <span class="emphasis"><em>rigor mortis</em></span>).</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00190"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655353.png.jpg" alt="104°F / 40°C and 122°F / 50°C: Proteins in Fish and Meat Begin to Denature"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Denaturation temperatures of various types of proteins (top portion) and standard doneness levels (bottom portion).</em></span></p></div></div><p><a id="iddle1673" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2401" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2550" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2603" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2700" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2873" class="indexterm"/>Somewhere around 8 to 24 hours later, the glycogen supply is exhausted and enzymes naturally present in the meat begin to break down the bonds created during rigor mortis (<span class="emphasis"><em>postmortem proteolysis</em></span>). Butchering before this process has run its course will affect the texture of the meat. Sensory panels have found that chicken breasts cut off the carcass before rigor mortis was over have a tougher texture than meat left on the bone longer. And since time is money, much mass-produced meat is slaughtered and then butchered straightaway. (I <span class="emphasis"><em>knew</em></span> there was a reason why roasted whole birds taste better!)</p><p>Proteins in meat can be divided into three general categories: myofibrillar proteins (found in muscle tissue, these enable muscles to contract), stromal proteins (connective tissue, including tendons, that provide structure), and sarcoplasmic proteins (e.g., blood). We’ll talk about myofibrillar proteins here and save the stromal proteins for the section on collagen later in the chapter. (We’re going to ignore sarcoplasmic proteins altogether, because understanding them doesn’t help in cooking many dishes, blood-thickened soups aside.)</p><p>Muscle tissue is primarily composed of only a few types of proteins, with myosin and actin being the two most important types in cooking. About two-thirds of the proteins in mammals are myofibrillar proteins. The amount of actin and myosin differs by animal type and region. Fish, for example, are made up of roughly twice as much of these proteins as mammals.</p><p>Lean meat is mostly water (65–80%), protein (16–22%), and fat (1.5–13%), with sugars such as glycogen (0.5–1.3%) and minerals (1%) contributing only a minor amount of the mass. When it comes to cooking a piece of fish or meat, the key to success is to understand how to manipulate the proteins and fats. Although fats can be a significant portion of the mass, they are relatively easy to manage, because they don’t provide toughness. This leaves proteins as the key variable in cooking meats.</p><p>Of the proteins present in meat, myosin and actin are the most important from a culinary texture perspective. If you take only one thing away from this section, let it be this: denatured myosin = yummy; denatured actin = yucky. Dry, overcooked meats aren’t tough because of lack of water inside the meat; they’re tough because on a microscopic level, the actin proteins have denatured and squeezed out liquid in the muscle fibers. Myosin in fish begins to noticeably denature at temperatures as low as 104°F / 40°C; actin denatures at around 140°F / 60°C. In land animals, which have to survive warmer environments and heat waves, myosin denatures in the range of 122–140°F / 50–60°C (depending on exposure time, pH, etc.) while actin denatures at around 150–163°F / 66–73°C.</p><p><a id="iddle1248" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1404" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1409" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1586" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2056" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2253" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2257" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2291" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2306" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2310" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2325" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2814" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2827" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3155" class="indexterm"/>Food scientists have determined through empirical research ("total chewing work" and "total texture preference" being my favorite terms) that the optimal texture of cooked meats occurs when they are cooked to 140–153°F / 60–67°C, the range in which myosin and collagen will have denatured but actin will remain in its native form. In this temperature range, red meat has a pinkish color and the juices run dark red.</p><p>The texture of some cuts of meat can be improved by tenderizing. Marinades and brines chemically tenderize the flesh, either enzymatically (examples include bromelain, an enzyme found in pineapple, and zingibain, found in fresh ginger) or as a solvent (some proteins are soluble in salt solutions). Dry aging steaks works by giving enzymes naturally present in the meat time to break down the structure of collagen and muscle fibers. Dry aging will affect texture for at least the first seven days. Dry aging also changes the flavor of the meat: less aged beef tastes more metallic, more aged tastes gamier. Which is "better" is a matter of personal taste preference. (Perhaps some of us are physiologically more sensitive to metallic tastes.) Retail cuts are typically 5 to 7 days old, but some restaurants use meat aged 14 to 21 days.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="soy_ginger_marinade"/><p class="title">Soy Ginger Marinade</p><p>The salt in the soy sauce and zingibain in the ginger give this marinade both chemical and enzymatic tenderizers. Mix this up, transfer it to a resealable bag, and toss in some meat, such as flank steaks.

(Some industrial meat processors "tenderize" meat by microscopically slicing it using very thin needles, a method called jacquarding.) Applying heat to meats "tenderizes" them by physically altering the proteins on the microscopic scale: as the proteins denature, they loosen up and uncurl. In addition to denaturing, upon uncurling, newly exposed regions of one protein can come into contact with regions of another protein and form a bond, allowing them to link to each other. This process is called <span class="emphasis"><em>coagulation</em></span>, and while it typically occurs in cooking that involves protein denaturation, it is a separate phenomenon.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00191"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655355.png.jpg" alt="Soy Ginger Marinade"/></div><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00192"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655357.png.jpg" alt="Soy Ginger Marinade"/><div class="caption"><p><a id="iddle1580" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1628" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1723" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2323" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>Temperatures required for various levels of doneness.

Eggs are the wonder food of the kitchen—they have a light part, a dark part, and bind the culinary world together. Used in both savory and sweet foods, they act as binders holding together meatloaf and stuffing; as rising agents in soufflés, certain cakes, and cookies like meringues; and as emulsifiers in sauces like mayonnaise and hollandaise. Eggs provide structure to custards and body to ice creams. And all of this so far doesn’t even touch on their flavor or the simple joys of a perfectly cooked farm egg. Simply put, I cannot think of another ingredient whose absence would bring my cooking to a halt faster than the simple egg.</p><p>Egg whites are composed of dozens of different types of proteins, and each type of protein begins to denature at a different temperature. In their natural "native" state, you can think of the proteins as curled-up little balls. They take this shape because portions of the molecular structure are <span class="emphasis"><em>hydrophobic</em></span>—the molecular arrangement of the atoms making up the protein is such that regions of the protein are electromagnetically repulsed by the polar charge of water.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00200"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655373.png.jpg" alt="144°F / 62°C: Eggs Begin to Set"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Important temperatures in eggs.</em></span></p></div></div><p>Because of this aversion to water, the protein structure folds up on itself. As kinetic energy is added to the system—in the form of heat or mechanical energy (e.g., whipping egg whites)—the structure starts to unfold as kinetic energy overtakes potential energy. The unfolded proteins then get tangled together, "snagging" around other denatured proteins and coagulating to form a linked structure. This is why a raw egg white is liquid, but once cooked becomes solid. (Well, technically, raw egg white is a gel that coagulates into a solidlike substance when heated. We’ll get to gels in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Playing with Chemicals">Chapter 6</a>.)</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00201"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655375.png.jpg" alt="144°F / 62°C: Eggs Begin to Set"/><div class="caption"><p><a id="iddle2594" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>Hydrophobic proteins in their native state (left) remain curled up to avoid interacting with the surrounding liquid. Under heat, they denature (center) and uncurl as the kinetic energy exceeds the weaker level of energy generated by water molecules and regions of the proteins that repel each other. Once denatured and opened up, the hydrophobic parts of the protein that were previously unexposed can interact and bond with other proteins.</em></span></p></div></div><p>The most heat-sensitive protein is ovotransferrin, which begins to denature at around 144°F / 62°C. Another protein, ovalbumin, denatures at around 176°F / 80°C. These two proteins also are the most common in egg whites: ovotransferrin accounts for 12% of the proteins in an egg white and ovalbumin 54%. This explains the difference between soft-boiled and hard-boiled ("hard-cooked") eggs. Get that egg up to about 176°F / 80°C for sufficient time, and voilà, the white is hard cooked; below that temperature, however, the ovalbumin proteins remain curled up, leaving the majority of the egg white in its "liquid" state.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note23"/>Note</h3><p>Most of the proteins in egg yolks set at between 149°F / 65°C and 158°F / 70°C, although some set at lower temperatures.</p></div><p>Proteins in foods such as eggs don’t denature instantaneously once they reach denaturation temperature. This is an important point. Some cooking newbies have the mental model that cooking an egg or a piece of meat is something like melting an ice cube: all ice below a certain temperature, ice and water at the freezing/melting point, and all water above that temperature. From a practical perspective in the kitchen, it’s not an entirely incorrect picture, because heat pours into the foods so quickly that the subtle differences between a few degrees aren’t obvious. But as heat is transferred into the food more slowly, the subtleties of these chemical reactions become more noticeable. And unlike melting an ice cube, where increasing the heat transfer by a factor of two causes the ice to melt in half the time, cooking foods do not respond to additional energy in a linear fashion.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00202"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655377.png.jpg" alt="144°F / 62°C: Eggs Begin to Set"/></div><p><a id="iddle1234" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1238" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1619" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1623" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1627" class="indexterm"/>You might find it easiest to think of the different proteins in foods as having particular temperatures at which they denature, and try to shoot for a target temperature just above that of the proteins you do want denatured. Just remember: there’s more to a piece of meat or egg than one type of protein or connective tissue, and the different proteins have different temperature points at which they’re likely to denature.</p><p>Here are some examples of cooking eggs that show how to take advantage of the thermal properties of different portions of the egg.</p><div class="sect3" title="Hard-Cooked Eggs, Shock and Awe Method"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="hard-cooked_eggscomma_shock_and_awe_meth"/>Hard-Cooked Eggs, Shock and Awe Method</h3></div></div></div><p>There’s a silent war of PC-versus-Mac proportions going on over the ideal way to make hard-cooked eggs. Should you start in cold water and bring the water up to a boil with the eggs in them, or should you drop the eggs into already boiling water? The cold-start approach yields eggs that taste better, while the boiling-water approach yields eggs that are easier to peel. But can you have both?</p><p>Thinking about the thermal gradient from shell to center of egg, it would make sense that cooking an egg starting in cold water would result in a more uniform doneness. The delta between the center and outer temperatures will be smaller, meaning that the outer portion won’t be as overcooked once the center is set compared to the boiling-water method.</p><p>The conjecture for ease of peeling in the boiling water approach is that the hot water "shocks" the outer portion of the egg. Into industrial-grade cooking? Steam ’em at 7.5 PSI over atmospheric pressure and quick-release the pressure at the end of cooking to crack the shell. (Hmm, I wonder if one could do this in a pressure cooker...) But what about the rest of us? What if we shock the outside, and then cook in cold water?</p><p>Try it. Place your eggs into rapidly boiling water. After 30 seconds, transfer the eggs to a second pot containing cold tap water, bring to a boil, and then simmer. The second-stage cooking time will take about two minutes less than the normal cold-start approach. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes, depending upon how well cooked you like your eggs.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="The 30-Minute Scrambled Egg"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="three0-minute_scrambled_egg"/>The 30-Minute Scrambled Egg</h3></div></div></div><p>This method involves ultra-low heat, continuous stirring, and a vigilant eye.

If you’re cracking a few dozen eggs into a bowl for an omelet brunch at your local hacker house every week, let’s just say that odds are you’ll eventually crack a bad egg. Luckily, this isn’t a problem if those eggs are properly cooked and cross-contamination is avoided.</p><p><a id="iddle1235" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1620" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1824" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2274" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2677" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2678" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2794" class="indexterm"/>The real risk for salmonella in eggs is in dishes that use undercooked eggs that are then served to at-risk populations (e.g., infants, pregnant women, elderly or immunocompromised people). If you’re making a dish that contains raw or undercooked eggs—Caesar salad, homemade eggnog, mayonnaise, raw cookie dough—and want to serve that dish somewhere where there might be at-risk individuals, you can pasteurize the eggs (assuming your local store doesn’t happen to carry pasteurized eggs, but most don’t). Pasteurized eggs do taste a little different, and the whites take longer to whip into a foam, so don’t expect them to be identical to their raw counterparts.</p><p>Since salmonella begins to die at a noticeable rate around 136°F / 58°C and the proteins in eggs don’t begin to denature until above 141°F / 61°C, you can pasteurize eggs to reduce the quantity of salmonella, should it be present, to an acceptable level by holding the egg at a temperature between these two points. The FDA requires a 10,000-fold reduction (5 log<sub>10</sub> in food safety lingo), which can be achieved by holding the egg at 141°F / 61°C for 3.5 minutes (according to Margaret McWilliams’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Foods: Experimental Perspectives,</em></span> Fifth Edition, from Pearson Publishing). Most consumers won’t have the necessary hardware to do this at home, but if you do have a sous vide setup, as described in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Fun with Hardware">Chapter 7</a>, you’re golden.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="The 60-Minute Slow-Cooked Egg"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="six0-minute_slow-cooked_egg"/>The 60-Minute Slow-Cooked Egg</h3></div></div></div><p>Going back to our earlier discussion of time and temperature, when food is left in an environment long enough, its temperature will come to match that of its environment. Therefore, if we immerse an egg in water held at 145°F / 62.7°C, it follows that the proteins in the white and the yolk that denature at or below that temperature will denature and coagulate, and those that denature above that temperature will remain unaltered.</p><p>The added benefit of this method is that the egg <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot overcook</em></span>. "Cooking" is effectively the occurrence of chemical reactions in the food at different temperature points, and holding the egg at 145°F / 62.7°C will not trigger any reactions that don’t occur until higher temperatures are reached. This is the fundamental concept of sous vide cooking. We’ll cover the details of sous vide in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Fun with Hardware">Chapter 7</a>, so you may want to take a peek at that chapter now or make a mental note to come back to this section when you get there. For a sous vide–style cooked egg, immerse an egg in water that is maintained at 145°F / 62.7°C for one hour. As you’ll see, sous vide cooking has some incredible properties that greatly simplify the time and temperature rule.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note24"/>Note</h3><p>Your average, run-of-the-mill (or is that run-of-the-yard?) chicken laid only 84 eggs per year a century ago.

You can think of most connective tissues—loose fascia and ligaments between muscles as well as other structures such as tendons and bones—as a bit like steel reinforcement: they don’t actively contract like muscle tissue, but they provide structure against which muscles can pull and contract.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00204"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655381.png.jpg" alt="154°F / 68°C: Collagen (Type I) Denatures"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Temperatures related to collagen hydrolysis and the resulting gelatin.</em></span></p></div></div><p>The most common type of protein in connective tissue is collagen, and while there are several types of collagen in animals, from a culinary perspective, the main chemical difference between the different types of collagen is the temperature at which they denature. In cooking, collagen shows up in two different ways: either as discrete chunks (e.g., tendons, silverskin) outside of the muscle, or as a network that runs through the muscle. Regardless of its location, collagen is tough (it provides structure, after all) and becomes palatable only given sufficient time at sufficiently high temperatures.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00205"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655383.png.jpg" alt="154°F / 68°C: Collagen (Type I) Denatures"/></div><p>It’s easy to deal with collagen that shows up as discrete pieces: get rid of it by cutting it off. For cuts of meats that have a thin layer of connective tissue on them (called <span class="emphasis"><em>silverskin</em></span>, presumably because of its somewhat iridescent appearance), cut off as much as possible and discard it. Beef tenderloin cuts commonly have a side with this layer; trim off as much as possible before cooking.</p><p>Chicken breasts also have a small but noticeable tendon connected to the chicken tenderloin. Uncooked, it’s a pearlescent white ribbon. After cooking, it turns into that small white rubber-band-like thing that you can chew on endlessly yet never get any satisfaction from. Generally, this type of collagen is easy to spot, and if you miss it, it’s easy to notice while eating and can be left on the plate.</p><p>However, for the other kind of collagen found in some cuts of meat—collagen that forms a 3D network through the muscle tissue—the only way to remove it is to convert it to gelatin via long, slow cooking methods. Unlike muscle proteins—which in cooking are either in a native (i.e., as they are in the animal), denatured, or hydrolyzed state—collagen, once hydrolyzed, <a id="iddle1405" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1511" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2006" class="indexterm"/>can enter a coagulated (gelled) state. This property opens up an entirely new world of possibilities, because gelatin gives meats a lubricious, tender quality and provides a lip-smacking goodness.</p><p>In its native form, collagen is like a rope: it’s a linear molecule composed of three different strands that are twisted together. The three strands are held together by weak secondary bonds (but there are a lot of them!) and stabilized by a small number of <span class="emphasis"><em>crosslinks</em></span>, which are stronger covalent bonds.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00206"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655385.png.jpg" alt="154°F / 68°C: Collagen (Type I) Denatures"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Collagen in its native form is a triple helix, held together in its helical structure by secondary bonds (left) and stabilized by crosslinks. Under heat, the secondary bonds break and the protein becomes denatured, but the crosslinks between the strands continue to hold the structure together (second from left). Given sufficient heat and time, the strands in the triple helix themselves break down via hydrolysis (third from left) and, upon cooling, convert to a loose network of molecules (right) that retains water (a gel).</em></span></p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note26"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Covalent bonds</em></span> are bonds where the electrons from an atom in one location are shared with another atom.</p></div><p>In addition to being crosslinked, the strands also form a helical structure because of secondary bonds between different regions of the same molecules. You can think of it something like a braided rope, where each strand wraps around the other two strands. It has a "curl" to it because the internal structure finds its optimal resting place in that shape.</p><p>Under the right conditions—usually, exposure to heat or the right kinds of acids—the native form of collagen denatures, losing its linear structure and untwisting into a random mess. With the addition of sufficient heat, the molecules in the structure will vibrate enough to overcome the electromagnetic energy that caused the structure to twist up in the first place, leading it to lose its helical structure and denature.</p><p>Acids can also denature the collagen protein: their chemical properties provide the necessary electromagnetic pull to disrupt the secondary bonds of the helical structure. It’s only the twisting that goes away during denaturing in collagen; the crosslinks remain in place and the <a id="iddle1009" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1024" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1873" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1885" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2258" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2288" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2311" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2326" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2478" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3004" class="indexterm"/>strands remain intact. In this form, collagen is like rubber—it actually is a rubber from a material science point of view—and for this reason, you’ll find its texture, well, rubbery.</p><p>Given even more heat or acid, though, the collagen structure undergoes <span class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> transformation: the strands themselves get chopped up and lose their backbone, and at this point the collagen has no real large-scale structure left. This reaction is called <span class="emphasis"><em>hydrolysis</em></span>: thermal hydrolysis in the case of heat, acid hydrolysis in the case of, you guessed it, acid. (Think ceviche. See the section on acids in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Playing with Chemicals">Chapter 6</a> for more.)</p><p>It’s possible to break up the collagen chemically, too: lysosomal enzymes will attack the structure and "break the covalent bonds" in chem-speak, but this isn’t so useful to know in the kitchen.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note27"/>Note</h3><p>For fun, try marinating a chunk of meat in papaya, which contains an enzyme, papain, that acts as a meat tenderizer by hydrolyzing collagen.</p></div><p>One piece of information that is critical to understand in the kitchen, however, is that hydrolysis takes time. The structure has to literally untwist and break up, and due to the amount of energy needed to break the bonds and the stochastic processes involved, this reaction takes longer than simply denaturing the protein.</p><p>Hydrolyzing collagen not only breaks down the rubbery texture of the denatured structure, but also converts a portion of it to gelatin. When the collagen hydrolyzes, it breaks into variously sized pieces, the smaller of which are able to dissolve into the surrounding liquid, creating gelatin. It’s this gelatin that gives dishes such as braised ox tail, slow-cooked short ribs, and duck confit their distinctive mouthfeel.</p><p>Since these dishes rely on gelatin for providing that wonderful texture, they need to be made with high-collagen cuts of meat. Trying to make a beef stew with lean cuts will result in tough, dry meat. The actin proteins will denature (recall that this occurs at temperatures of 150–163°F / 66–73°C), but the gelatin won’t be present in the muscle tissue to mask the dryness and toughness brought about by the denatured actin. Don’t try to "upgrade" your beef stew with a more expensive cut of meat; it won’t work!</p><p>"Great," you might be thinking, "but how does any of this tell me whether I need to slow-cook a piece of meat?" Think about the piece of meat (or fish or poultry) that you’re working with and consider what part of the animal it comes from. For a land-based animal, those regions of the animal that bear weight generally have higher levels of collagen. This should make sense: because the weight-bearing portions have a higher load, they need more <a id="iddle1510" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1697" class="indexterm"/>structure, so they’ll have more connective tissue. This isn’t a perfect rule of thumb, though, and cuts of meat generally have more than one muscle group in them.</p><p>For animals like fish, which don’t have to support their weight on land, the collagen levels are much lower. Squid and octopus are notable exceptions to this weight-bearing rule, because their collagen provides the equivalent support that bone structures do for fish.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00207"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655387.png.jpg" alt="154°F / 68°C: Collagen (Type I) Denatures"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>When cooking a piece of meat, if it’s from a part that is responsible for supporting the animal’s weight (primarily muscles in the chuck, rib, brisket, and round), it’ll probably be higher in collagen and thus need a longer cooking time.</em></span></p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04note28"/>Note</h3><p>Older animals have higher levels of collagen. As animals age, the collagen structure has more time to form additional crosslinks between the strands in the collagen helix, resulting in increased toughness. This is why older chickens, for example, are traditionally cooked in long, slow roasts. (The French go so far as to use different words for old versus young chickens: <span class="emphasis"><em>poule</em></span> instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>poulet</em></span>.) Most commercial meat, however, is young at time of slaughter, so the age of the animal is no longer an important factor.</p></div><p>The other easy rule of thumb for collagen levels is to look at the relative price of the meat: because high-collagen cuts require more work to cook and come out with a generally drier texture, people tend to favor other cuts, so the high-collagen cuts are cheaper.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="squid_bruschetta"/><p class="title">Squid Bruschetta</p><p><a id="iddle1720" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2233" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2834" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>Squid was a culinary mystery to me for a long time.

You can create larger slices by cutting on a bias. (Save the triangular end piece for munching on when no one is looking.) Lightly coat both sides of the bread with olive oil (this is normally done with a pastry brush, but if you don’t have one, you can either fold up a paper towel and "brush" with it or pour olive oil onto a plate and briefly dip the bread into the oil). Toast the bread. A broiler works best (the slices of bread should be 4–6″ / 10–15 cm from the heat). Flip as soon as they begin to turn golden brown. If you don’t have a broiler, you can use an oven set to 400°F / 200°C.

In their raw form, starches exist as semicrystalline structures that your body can only partially digest. Cooking causes them to melt, absorb water, swell, and convert to a form that can be more easily broken down by your digestive system.</p><p>As with most other reactions in cooking, the point at which starch granules gelatinize depends on more than just the single variable of temperature. The type of starch, the length of time at temperature, the amount of moisture in the environment, and processing conditions all impact the point at which any particular starch granule swells up and gelatinizes. See the section <a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#making_gelscolon_starches" title="Making gels: Starches">Making gels: Starches</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Playing with Chemicals">Chapter 6</a> for more about starches and gelatinization.</p><p>Leafy green vegetables also undergo changes when cooked. Most noticeably, they lose their green color as the membranes around the chloroplasts in the cells rupture. This same rupturing and damage to the cell structure is what improves the texture of tougher greens such as Swiss chard and kale.</p><p>For starchy plants (think potatoes), cook them so that they reach the temperature at which they gelatinize, typically in the range of 180–190°F / 92–99°C.

It breaks down over time, which is why riper fruits become softer.</p><p>Cooking also breaks down pectin, and as a kitchen chemistry experiment, you can capture the pectin from cooked fruits. It’s an easy way to see that some food additives aren’t so industrial after all, at least not in their sources.</p><p>The pectin we use in cooking—primarily in jams and jellies, as a thickener—is divided into two broad types: low- and high-methoxyl. High-methoxyl pectin requires a high concentration of sugar in order to gel; low-methoxyl pectin will gel in the presence of calcium. (The difference between the two types has to do with the number of linkages in the molecular structure.)</p><p>If you’re making jams or jellies, using a low-methoxyl pectin (such as Pomona’s Pectin) removes the variable of sugar concentration. See Tim O’Reilly’s tips for making jam in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Air: Baking’s Key Variable">Chapter 5</a> in <a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html#tim_oapostrophereillyapostrophes_scones" title="Tim O’Reilly’s Scones and Jam">Tim O’Reilly’s Scones and Jam</a>.</p><p>Making your own pectin is similar to making your own gelatin: start with a couple of pounds of tissue, boil away, and then filter it out. Instead of animal bones, pectin comes from the "bones" of cell walls in plant tissue.</p><p>Start with a few pounds of crisp apples. (The firmer the better! They don’t need to be ripe.) Chop them into quarters and place the pieces in a stockpot. Cover with water and simmer on low for several hours, stirring occasionally. (This is exactly the way stock is made.) After several hours, you should have a slushy sauce. Filter this through a strainer. (See the section on filtration in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Fun with Hardware">Chapter 7</a> for tips.) The slimy liquid that you filter out is the pectin.</p><p>Using homemade pectin will be a bit trickier than Pomona’s Pectin, for two reasons. First, it’s high-methoxyl pectin, so you’ll need to have a proper balance of sugar in whatever you’re attempting to gel. And secondly, the concentration of pectin to water will be unknown, so you will have to experiment some. Add a small quantity and test if it gels; if not, add more. If the liquid pectin seems too thin, you can boil it down further to create a more concentrated pectin.</p><p>For more ideas and tips on testing homemade pectin, see <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.wildflowers-and-weeds.com/The_Forager/pectin.htm">http://www.wildflowers-and-weeds.com/The_Forager/pectin.htm</a></em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00216"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655405.png.jpg" alt="Make Your Own Pectin"/></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="sauteacuteed_greens"/><p class="title">Sautéed Greens</p><p><a id="iddle2708" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3081" class="indexterm"/>In a sauté or nonstick pan preheated over medium heat, add:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>1 bunch Swiss chard, collard greens, or other hardy leafy green vegetable; stems and thick veins removed, and sliced into 1″ strips</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>2 tablespoons (26g) olive oil (enough to coat the pan)</strong></span></p></li></ol></div><p>Using tongs, quickly toss the greens to coat them with oil.

You can thank Maillard reactions for the nice golden-brown color and rich aromas of a Thanksgiving turkey, Fourth of July hamburger, and Sunday brunch bacon. If you’re still not able to conjure up the tastes brought about by Maillard reactions, take two slices of white bread and toast them—one until just before it begins to turn brown, the second until it has a golden-brown color—and taste the difference.</p><p>The nutty, toasted, complex flavors generated by the Maillard reaction are created by the hundreds of compounds formed when amino acids and certain types of sugars combine and then break down. Named after the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard, who first described it in the 1910s, the Maillard reaction is specifically a reaction between amino acids (from proteins) and reducing sugars, which are sugars that form aldehydes or ketone-based organic compounds in an alkaline solution (which allows them to react with the amines). Glucose, the primary sugar in muscle tissue, is a reducing sugar; sucrose (common table sugar) is not.</p><p>Maillard reactions aren’t solely dependent on temperature. Besides temperature, there are a number of other variables that affect the reaction rate. More alkaline foods undergo Maillard reactions more easily. Egg whites, for example, can undergo Maillard reactions at the lower temperatures and higher pressure found in a pressure cooker. The amount of water and the types and availability of reactants in the food also determine the rate at which Maillard reactions will occur. It’s even possible for Maillard reactions to happen at room temperature, given sufficient time and reagents: self-tanning products work via the same chemical reaction!</p><p>All things considered, though, in culinary applications—cooking at moderately hot temperatures for short periods of time—the 310°F / 154°C temperature given here serves as a good marker of when Maillard reactions begin to occur at a noticeable rate, whether you’re looking through your oven door or sautéing on the stovetop.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00225"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655433.png.jpg" alt="310°F / 154°C: Maillard Reactions Become Noticeable"/></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="butterflied_chickencomma_broiled_and_roa"/><p class="title">Butterflied Chicken, Broiled and Roasted</p><p><a id="iddle1364" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2214" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2287" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2648" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>You might be the type who prefers to let the butcher do the butchering, but it’s worth learning how to butterfly a chicken (this is also known as</em></span> spatchcocking), <span class="emphasis"><em>even if you’re squeamish about raw meat.

Because the skin is on one side and the bone on the other, you can use two different heat sources to cook the two sides to their correct level of doneness. That is, you can effectively cook the skin side until it’s brown from Maillard reactions, and then flip the bird over and finish cooking until a probe thermometer or manual inspection indicates that it is done.</p><p>Rub the outside of the butterflied chicken with olive oil and sprinkle it with salt. (The oil will prevent the skin from drying out while cooking.) Place the bird on top of a wire roasting tray in a roasting pan, skin side up. (The wire tray raises the bird up off the pan so that it doesn’t stew in the drippings that come out.) Tuck the wings up, over and under the breasts so that they’re not exposed to the broiler.</p><p>Broil at medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until the skin develops a nice level of brownness. Keep a good 6″ / 15 cm between the bird and the heating element of your oven. If your broiler is particularly strong and parts of it begin to burn, you can create a "mini-heat shield" with aluminum foil.</p><p>Once the skin side has browned, flip the bird over (I use folded-over paper towels instead of tongs to avoid tearing the skin). Switch the oven to bake mode, at around 350°F / 177°C. Ideally, use a probe thermometer set to beep at 160°F / 71°C (carryover will take it up to 165°F / 74°C). If you don’t have a probe thermometer, check for doneness after around 25 minutes by cutting off one leg and checking that the juices run clear and the flesh looks cooked. If it’s not done, set the two halves back together and return it to the oven, checking periodically.</p><p><span class="bolditalic">Notes</span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Some people like to brine their chickens.

For more, see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#two_things_you_should_do_to_your_oven_ri" title="The Two Things You Should Do to Your Oven RIGHT NOW">The Two Things You Should Do to Your Oven RIGHT NOW</a> of <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Initializing the Kitchen">Chapter 2</a>.)</p><p>Like the Maillard reaction, caramelization results in hundreds of compounds being generated as a sugar decomposes, and these new compounds result in both browning and the generation of enjoyable aromas in foods such as baked goods, coffee, and roasted nuts. For some foods, these aromas, as wonderful as they might be, can overpower or interfere with the flavors brought by the ingredients, such as in a light gingersnap cookie or a brownie. For this reason, some baked goods are cooked at 350°F / 177°C or even 325°F / 163°C so that they don’t see much caramelization, while other foods are cooked at 375°F / 191°C or higher to facilitate it.</p><p>When cooking, ask yourself if what you are cooking is something that you want to have caramelize, and if so, set your oven to at least 375°F / 191°C. If you’re finding that your food isn’t coming out browned, it’s possible that your oven is running too cold. If items that shouldn’t be turning brown are coming out overdone, your oven is probably too hot.</p><p>Fructose, a simpler form of sugar found in fruit and honey, caramelizes at a lower temperature than sucrose, starting around 230°F / 110°C. If you have other constraints on baking temperature (say, water content in the dough prevents it from reaching a higher temperature), you can add honey to the recipe. This will result in a browner product, because the largest chemical component in honey is fructose (~40% by weight; glucose comes in second at ~30%).</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00234"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655451.png.jpg" alt="356°F / 180°C: Sugar Begins to Caramelize Visibly"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Temperatures related to sucrose caramelization and baking.</em></span></p></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="seeing_caramelization_with_sugar_cookies"/><p class="title">Seeing Caramelization with Sugar Cookies</p><p><a id="iddle1293" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1462" class="indexterm"/>Here’s an easy experiment to do with kids (or on your own), and regardless of the results, the data is delicious! Since sugar caramelizes in a relatively narrow temperature range, foods cooked below that temperature won’t caramelize. Thus, when making sugar cookies, you can determine whether they will come out a light or dark brown.</p><p>Try cooking four batches of sugar cookies at 325°F, 350°F, 375°F, and 400°F (163°C, 177°C, 190°C, and 204°C). Those cooked below the 356–370°F / 180–188°C range will remain light-colored, and those cooked at a temperature above sucrose’s caramelization point will turn a darker brown. It’s nice when science and reality line up!</p><p>This isn’t to say hotter cooking temperatures make for <span class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span> results than cooler ones. It’s a matter of personal preference. If you’re like some of my friends, you may think sugar cookies are "supposed" to be light brown and chewy, maybe because that’s the way your mom made them when you were growing up. Or maybe you like them a bit browner on the outside, like a rich pound cake.</p><p>Note that the flour used in sugar cookies contains some amount of proteins, and those proteins will undergo Maillard reactions, so cookies baked at 325°F / 163°C and 350°F / 177°C will develop some amount of brownness independent of caramelization.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00235"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages655453.png.jpg" alt="Seeing Caramelization with Sugar Cookies"/><div class="caption"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Cross-section (top piece) and top-down (bottom piece) views of sugar cookies baked at various temperatures.

A self-proclaimed "accidental pastry chef," he traveled around the United States extensively before working in a bakery, where he had his first big "aha" moment working with bread and discovered a passion for cooking.</em></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>What turned out to matter more than you expected? Just in the process of actually learning to cook.</strong></span></p><p>I guess that when I started cooking it was just something to do and once I developed a passion for it, I realized that—and I don’t want to overromanticize it or attach some sort of Anthony Bourdain sort of thing to it, but you kind of enter a culture and it’s a completely different culture. I’m sure other professions have it. I’m sure software guys have it. It’s just a weird subculture and once you kind of enter that it becomes a lifestyle, not really a job.</p><p>That’s truly how I feel. With other professional cooks there are obviously colloquialisms and certain physical characteristics that they could have. And then there’s also the reality of long hours, bad hours. You’re working when everyone is playing; I’ve come to embrace it and now it’s just ingrained in the fabric of my being that it’s just—I’m a cook before anything else. It kind of informs everything I do and everything I see. I see through that lens of food. For an outsider that might sound a little creepy, but it’s the truth. So when I started cooking, I had no idea that it would take over my life or present so many opportunities to experience other things. I can’t imagine giving anything up.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Being from a software background—from one weird subculture to another weird subculture—I hear you. I would be curious how you would describe your weird subculture.</strong></span></p><p>And actually I’ve spent time thinking about this: what is it about the actual craft of cooking or the act of cooking that does it, and a lot of it is the stress. Granted, it’s a self-imposed stress, meaning we’re not brain surgeons. We’re making people dinner, but dinner is important to a lot of people and especially at the highest ends there is a constant quest for perfection. You’re never going to attain perfect, but you can always push further. So I think it’s more of the environment of restaurant worlds that kind of informs a lot of that.</p><p>I think there is a lot to be said for the power of almost the meditative state that you get, even if you’re cooking alone, because you’re connecting with nature. You’re connecting with things.</p><p>You’re making something with your hands. You’re hopefully making something greater than the sum of its parts. It’s something that you can’t fully describe in words.</p><p>It’s just what I do. My wife works in a different restaurant. She runs the front of the house, so my work and home life—there’s really no separation. We have the same schedule, we come home, and we talk about the business. We wake up and we talk about the business. So it’s a lifestyle.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>As a pastry chef, are you more of a "by the recipe, exact measurements" type of cook or one who adds an ingredient and tastes, and makes course corrections as you go?</strong></span></p><p>Both. I started in bread and kind of worked in pastry, but I bounced back and forth between each side of the kitchen, between sweet and savory, for a little over five years before I decided to stick with the pastry thing. There is a cliché that pastry chefs are the calm, measured, exacting, precise kind of person and the line cook or the savory chef is the spontaneous one. There is some truth to that. I think the lines are blurring a little bit, but it’s really cross-training that gave me a solid foot in both, being spontaneous and being precise. Too much spontaneity, and it’s just cook-and-see and you’re ultimately lucky if you get the results that you want, but there is that joy in being spontaneous or even taking it further and taking an attitude of well, if it’s not broken, let’s break it and see what happens. That curiosity and spontaneity are not quite the same thing, but to me, they’re of the same spirit.</p><p><a id="iddle1499" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1577" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2135" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2625" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2730" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>So if someone is learning how to cook, it’s not really a question of them thinking about their own temperament and trying to match it up with baking or cooking; they should really do a bit of both to balance things out?</strong></span></p><p>Yes. It almost sounds like I’m talking out of both sides of my mouth. Because I rely on a recipe, especially in a restaurant situation, consistency is king. Everything has to be the same from batch to batch, day to day. Recipes are useful.</p><p>I actually just finished reading <span class="emphasis"><em>The Craftsman</em></span>, by a sociologist, Richard Sennett, who wrote a whole chapter on how-to manuals in the form of recipe writing. I think recipe writing is ultimately flawed. Compare your recipe with "how to set up a computer" or "how to build a shelf" or whatever: you have to tailor the instruction to the experience, to the emotional state, to the personality of the person who is going to be reading and following your recipe.</p><p>Recipes are important, but they’re also just guidelines or can serve as inspiration. I think it’s a natural evolution for a cook—whether it’s a professional cook obviously or a home cook—that with confidence, the recipe means less and less, that it can be used as simple inspiration. I still pull books off the shelf all the time, but rarely do I actually write it down. I’ll try to wrap my head around what somebody was trying to do, but that really can only come with confidence and experience.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>What are your favorite books that you go to?</strong></span></p><p>I would have to say that the Internet is probably my "go to" source right now. It almost feels like I’m being lazy, but I think the Internet has changed everything. It has certainly changed professional cooking—the evolution of it and the speed at which things have progressed. Granted, there is a lot of static you have to sift through to find something of use, increasingly so. But in terms of instant access and comparing and asking different things, I’ve almost come to favor just an Internet search.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>What would you tell somebody who is just learning to bake to keep in mind?</strong></span></p><p>First and foremost: cleanliness and organization are key, and they’re always going to save you. Pay attention, especially with baking, which is firmly dictated by the chemical and physical realms that you can’t always undo. Also, have that sense of fun and that sense of play and learn from mistakes rather than stressing out about them. It sounds kind of mystical, but I do have this belief that happy people make better-tasting food. I also tell young people: just absorb as much information as you can. It doesn’t feel like it’s sinking in or you’re comprehending it all. Cleanliness, organization, a sense of fun, a sense of play, and always reminding yourself that there is more to learn.</p><p>There are certain ways of doing things that ultimately find their way into the dish, whether they’re perceivable or not. Sometimes it’s about things like cleanliness and organization. When you’re eating a dish in a dining room, you’re not going to know whether the cook who made it has a dirty apron, but I like to think that that does work its way into it.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Can you give me an example of how you go about thinking about a recipe and putting a dish together?</strong></span></p><p>I have two. They both go toward understanding your ingredients and composition.</p><p>We used to make brown butter ice cream, but to give it enough brown butter flavor, we would have to add a ton of fat to the ice cream, which makes the ice cream really texturally challenging. Then I learned about the reaction and the composition of different kinds of dairy products. It’s actually just the milk solids in the butter that give us the flavor, but the butter by weight is only 2% solids. We stepped back and looked at heavy cream, which we produce butter from. That heavy cream has three times the milk solids that give us the flavor of butter. So if we take heavy cream and reduce it down to the point where we’re left with milk solids and clarified butter, we actually produce more extractable and arguably better-tasting brown butter solids than we could from butter. Then we separate it from the fat and add that to the ice cream.</p><p>We also do a lot with caramelized white chocolate. Sometimes I describe it as "roasted chocolate." It sounds kind of counterintuitive, that you’d never want to scorch your chocolate. But if you do it in a controlled way you get an almost <span class="emphasis"><em>dolce de leche</em></span>–like flavor. <span class="emphasis"><em>Dolce de leche</em></span> is usually made by cooking condensed milk; usually, people just boil the can for three or four hours. This gives you more complex flavors, because the proteins and the sugars in the milk and the added sugar are cooking together. If you look at the composition of white chocolate, it’s about 40% sugar and 23% milk solids. I researched the composition of condensed milk; the proportion of milk solids and the proportion of sugar are nearly identical. This was a huge connection for me to make personally in terms of substituting ingredients. From there, we’ve gone on to do all kinds of stuff with caramelized chocolate.</p></div><div class="sidebar"><a id="caramelized_white_chocolate"/><p class="title">Caramelized White Chocolate</p><p><a id="iddle1256" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1292" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1298" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1376" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1519" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1544" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2010" class="indexterm"/><span class="emphasis"><em>Inspired by Valrhona’s L’Ecole du Grand Chocolat</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The extent to which the white chocolate is "roasted" will determine the color and flavor of the finished cream.
